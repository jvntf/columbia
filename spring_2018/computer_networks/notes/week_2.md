 1. Packet switching
    * path and hops dictate delay time
    * queuing and loss
        - stability and condition
        - water model
            + fill funnel with water, drips out one drop at a time
        - packets behaves somewhat similarly to traffic
        - 
    *  transmissions lines were used as short term memory
    *  
 2. TWo key network core functions
    * routing
        - determine path for packet
        - need to get there quickly
        - need to get there when part of network is down
        - the problem is that it is hard to know the full view
        - 
    * forwarding
        - move packets from router input to output
        - packet header has destination address as it gets passed from node to node

 3. alternative core: circuit switching
    * fdm vs tdm
        - divide frequency or divide time
        - 
    * 
 4.  packet switching vs circuit switching
    * packet switching is better for bursty data
    * assumes that only a small percentage of users are on the network at any given time
    * possible to combine 
    * circuit switching establishes direct and dedicated connection between 2 nodes, gaurentees full bandwith of the conneciton
    * packet switching is on-demand allocation
 5.  Networks of Networks
    * telegraph preceded the internet
    * Internet 2 is internet specific to universities
    * can ISPs connect to every other ISPs
    * IXPs (internet exchange point) and peering links  
    * network tiers
        - consensus based status
        - entities that did not pay anyone for peering (exchange traffic but no money)
 6. Transit networks
    * networks that provide traffic to other places on the internet
    * wholesale internet provider 
 7.  submarine network cable
    * 1901 cable map resembles modern fiber map  
 8.  bandwith
    * 
 9.  loss and delay
    * packets queue in router buffers
    * arrival rate might be faster than departure rate
    * processing time, queue time, transmission delay, propagation delay (speed of light delay)
        - speed of light is slightly slower in fiber than it is normally
    * 
 10.  traceroute
    * provides delay measurements
 11.
