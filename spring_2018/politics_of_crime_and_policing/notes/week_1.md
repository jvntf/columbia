     *  elementary forms of religious life
     *  any social order has certain characteristics that emerge
         - crime is almost necessary for social cohesion
         - represents transgression
             + collectively ignores the norm
         - goal of punishment is not to eliminate crime
             + enforce the collective agreement of the norm
             + this interpretation gives no indication of where power is
 2. Robert K. Merton

         - internalization of broadly shared social norms by individual who  lack the institutional means to achieve them
         - accumulation is the norm

         -  materialism governs all relations
         -  "Crime is a primitive form of insurrection"
         -  "the criminal therefore appears as one of those natural  'equilibrating foces' which establish a just balance and open up a  whole perspective of 'useful' occulations".
         -  criminal produces crime, and professor of crime
         -  the criminal produces all professions that revolve around crime
             +  produces law, art, literature etc
             +  interrupts the monotony and security of bourgousie life

            +  admin staff successfully upholds a claim on the monopoly on the legi useage of violence
            +  the state is the *only* entity that has a legit use of violence
